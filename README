lrcat extractor
===============

Extract the data from Adobe Lightroom catalogs (currently version 2, 4
and 6) in order to facilitate importing it into another application.

This is written in Rust.

Requires:
- Rust (1.29)
- cargo to build

The is a crate (library) meant to be used by other applications. Its
goal is to abstract the format away into an API that can be used to
import into an application.

Building
--------

This is meant to be used by another application, so you need to add
to your `Cargo.toml` the crate:

`lrcat-extractor = 0.1.0`

To build the crate, simply:

$ cargo build

The crate comes with a dumper utility, that's used mostly for
debugging. It is hidden behind a "feature".

$ cargo run --features=binaries

Using
-----

```Rust
let mut catalog = Catalog::new(&path_to_catalog);
if catalog.open() {
    // check the catalog is the right version
    if !catalog.catalog_version.is_supported() {
        println!("Unsupported catalog version");
        return;
    }
}
```
